# TheDND
My first ever game developed. I used Godot to develop the game with GDScript which is a python-inspired robust language. It took me well near a week to develop the game fully.
All of the resources are uploaded here and you are free to use any or all of them. You move using A and D, to move towards left and right respectively. Use W and SPACE to jump.
A preview of the game is also uploaded on my linkedin profile, link is: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nehul-bhatnagar-430a17196_gamedevelopment-animations-animation2d-ugcPost-6698145933898719232-oa5R
